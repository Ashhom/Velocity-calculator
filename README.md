# Velocity-calculator
A C# programme that determines the end velocity of an object undergoing constant acceleration is available in this repository. Based on the provided initial velocity, acceleration, and time, the programme reliably calculates the ultimate velocity using the laws of motion. This application offers an easy and efficient way to address velocity-related issues, whether you're a physics student or someone simply interested in learning about fundamental motion ideas. The code is well-documented and useful for learning purposes or as a useful tool for calculating velocity in actual situations.
